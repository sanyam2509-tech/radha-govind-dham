        <p>
            The moment the name <strong>Jagadguru Shri Kripalu Ji Maharaj</strong> is uttered, the divine form of Radha Krishna naturally manifests in one's heart. Shri Maharaj Ji spent his entire life distributing causeless grace upon the souls of this Kaliyuga. To ensure that this stream of devotion reached every corner of the world, he inspired his own spiritual extensions to dedicate their lives to the propagation of Bhakti.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our beloved Didi, <strong>Sushri Braj Bhuvaneshwari Devi Ji</strong>, is one such divine soul—a dedicated preacher whose very identity is surrendered to the service of her Master.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            "It is difficult to introduce Didi Ji in words, for in her conduct, her speech, and her every action, one sees only Shri Maharaj Ji. She is a pure reflection of his Grace."
        </div>

        <h2>Early Divine Life</h2>
        <p>
            Didi Ji appeared in this material world on <strong>September 22, 1971</strong>, in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. She was born into a family that was already drenched in devotion; her parents were exclusive devotees of Shri Maharaj Ji, and her three sisters and two brothers also grew up as dedicated <em>satsangis</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spiritual elevation of her family is evident from a profound incident in 1978. When Didi Ji’s mother was in the service of Shri Maharaj Ji, he gave her a divine command:
            <br><br>
            <em>"There are six of my devotees in your home. Do not harbor any worldly attachment towards them. Raise them only as a matter of duty, for they belong to God."</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Education & Renunciation</h2>
        <p>
            Following Maharaj Ji's guidance, Didi Ji excelled in her academics. She completed her B.A., M.A., and M.Phil with distinction. However, while pursuing her Ph.D., a wave of <strong>Sahaj Vairagya</strong> (natural detachment) overcame her. Realizing that the ultimate knowledge lies not in books but in the feet of the Guru, she left her academic pursuits to walk the path of renunciation.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mission Begins</h2>
        <p>
            On the auspicious occasion of <strong>Diwali, 1998</strong>, Shri Maharaj Ji formally declared her as his Pracharika (Preacher) and bestowed upon her the name <strong>"Braj Bhuvaneshwari."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, she has been a torchbearer of his philosophy. To establish a center for devotion, she constructed the divine ashram <strong>"Shri Kripalu Kunj"</strong> in Bathinda, Punjab, under Maharaj Ji's command. Expanding this vision further to the Himalayas, she established <strong>Radha Govind Dham</strong> in Chail, creating a sanctuary for seekers worldwide.
